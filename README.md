# Fake Voice Detection System
 This project is dedicated to the development of a library for the definition of synthesized speech based on machine learning algorithms.
 In this project, various kepstral coefficients are used that stand out from the signal and a verdict is made based on the Bi-LSTM neural network, whether the voice is fake or not.
 Also, this library contains an already pre-trained model.
